 * a deploy that replays a stale artifact, or one that bakes the wrong build-time flag, still exits
 * zero and still deploys.
 *
 * Both are conditional on the command mentioning vp or a builder, so neither fires on a `deploy`
 * that runs no codegen whatsoever. build-gatekeeper-configurator.test.ts requires that positively,
 * for the packages where it is a requirement.
