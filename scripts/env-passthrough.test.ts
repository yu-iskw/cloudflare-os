/**
 * A cached `vp` run executes each task in a clean environment: only a built-in set (`PATH`, `HOME`,
 * `CI`, ...) is forwarded, and anything else is invisible to the command *and* absent from the cache
 * fingerprint unless the task declares it in `env`. Measured, on a task declaring one variable:
 *
 *     vp run --cache <task>      declared: yes   undeclared: undefined
 *     vp run <task>              declared: yes   undeclared: undefined   (tasks cache by default)
 *     vp run --no-cache <task>   declared: yes   undeclared: yes
 *
 * So an undeclared build-time variable is silently dropped everywhere except an explicitly uncached
 * run, and the build still succeeds. This snapshot is the guard: it discovers every build-time env
 * read in the workspace and requires each one to be accounted for below, so adding a read without
 * deciding how it reaches the build fails here rather than shipping a wrongly-built artifact.
 *
 * Categories:
 *   forwarded — matched by an `env` pattern on this package's task, so it is passed *and*
 *               fingerprinted; changing it is a reported cache miss rather than a stale replay.
 *   uncached  — the task that reads it is `cache: false`, so it runs with the full ambient
 *               environment. Used where `env` would be unsound: `FORMAT_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` names a
 *               directory outside the workspace, and `env` fingerprints the value, not the contents.
 *   injected  — set explicitly by the build setup, never inherited. Stripping is correct here:
 *               `build-app.mjs` always passes `GATEKEEPER_APP_UNMINIFIED`, and the frontend build
 *               task sets `NODE_ENV` before importing Vite.
 *   external  — read outside any vp task (release/dev tooling invoked directly), so vp never
 *               filters it.
