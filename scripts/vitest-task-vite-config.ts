/**
 * Shared Vite+ `test` task for every package whose tests run under vitest, used by each such
 * package's `vite.config.ts`. Plain objects rather than `defineConfig`, so the packages need no
 * resolvable `vite-plus` import of their own. The task types below are structural copies of
 * Vite+'s rather than imports of them, which is what keeps that true.
 *
 * TypeScript, unlike the `.mjs` beside it in this directory, because being TS means a malformed task
 * or a mistyped `base` is a compile error rather than a glob that silently never matches.
 *
 * Reached as `@gadgets/scripts/vitest-task`, an `exports` subpath of this directory's package, not
 * as a relative path. A relative specifier only resolves for a consumer at `packages/<name>/` of
 * this workspace, which is not true of the forks that vendor this repo as a submodule. Note that
 * this module is loaded by `node` as well as by vite -- vp resolves it through the `exports` map
 * when it loads a consumer's task graph -- so intra-directory imports must name the file on disk
 * (`./vitest-task-vite-config.ts`); the `.js` specifier only vite remaps would not resolve.
 *
 * `test` is a task rather than a package.json script so the scratch paths every `vitest run` writes
 * and then reads back can be kept out of the fingerprint: vp declines to cache a task that reads a
 * path it also wrote, and without these exclusions almost nothing cached. vp forbids a task and a
 * script sharing a name, so the packages have no `test` script any more and
 * `vp run -F <package> test` is what replaces `pnpm --filter <package> test`.

 * Paths vitest generates and reads back on the next run, excluded from both the fingerprint and the

 *
 * - `node_modules/.vite/vitest/<project-hash>/results.json` -- per-file durations and pass/fail,
 *   read by vitest's `BaseSequencer` to order failed-first and slowest-first. Distinct from the
 *   sibling `node_modules/.vite/deps`, which is a real transform cache.
 * - `node_modules/.vite-temp/*.config.ts.timestamp-*.mjs` -- vite's default `bundle` config loader
 *   compiles a TS config to a temp module here, imports it, then unlinks it. The name carries a
 *   timestamp, so every run writes a fresh path and no run could ever match a previous fingerprint.
 * - `.validate/**` -- optional codegen scratch regenerated and then loaded by a suite.
 *   It is derived from sources that are tracked, so dropping it from the fingerprint loses
 *   no invalidation.
 *
 * These are tool-managed scratch paths that Vite+'s own cooperative tracking already excludes for
 * `vp build` (`guide/automatic-data-tracking.md` names `node_modules/.vite-temp` as a path that
 * "should not be inputs or outputs"), so excluding them is the blessed shape rather than a
 * workaround.
 *
 * Workspace-wide rather than package-relative: tracking reaches past the package that owns the
 * task, so a sibling's scratch files would otherwise stay in this package's fingerprint and the
 * packages would invalidate each other -- the same trap documented on `build:app`.
 *
 * This list is unlikely to be closed. When a test task stops caching, `vp run --last-details` names
 * the path it read and wrote -- add it here if it is shared, or at the call site if it is one
 * package's own (as `workshop-frontend`'s `dist/**` is).

 * vendors this repo as a submodule, where it silently resolves to a `scripts/` that holds none of
 * these builders. A bin name is both: fingerprint-stable and position-independent. vp puts the
 * consuming package's `node_modules/.bin` on the task's PATH, so it resolves wherever the package
 * lives, and a rename fails loudly with "Failed to find executable" rather than silently.

 * fingerprint reason: a cached `vp` run strips undeclared env vars, so an override would silently
 * not apply (and would owe `scripts/env-passthrough.test.ts` an entry). Here a policy change is a
