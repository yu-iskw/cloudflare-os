// It exists because nothing else in the test stack bounds a wedged run. Vite+ has no task timeout
// (`vp run --help` offers only concurrency flags, and `timeout` appears nowhere in its docs), and
// vitest's `testTimeout`/`hookTimeout` are enforced *inside* the test worker, so they die with it;
// the one process-level watchdog, `teardownTimeout`, is armed after the run resolves and therefore
// never arms when the run is what hangs.
//
// Silence is the primary detector rather than wall-clock: a healthy `vitest run` prints a line per
// completed test file, and a wedged one goes quiet. The total cap is the backstop for a command
// that stays chatty while looping forever.
//
// Exit codes: 124 when a threshold fired (GNU `timeout`'s, and distinct from any vitest code), the
// child's own code otherwise, or `128 + signal` when the child or this wrapper was signalled.
