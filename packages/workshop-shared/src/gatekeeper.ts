// This file defines the API that the AI Gadgets Workshop uses to talk to Adapters. Each Adapter
// provides connectivity to some external service which AI Gadgets can then manipulate. Each
// installation of the Gadgets Workshop may have access to different adapters, typically based on
// the set of internal services used at the particular company.
//
// For instance, there might be adapters for Google Workspace, GitHub, Jira, etc.
//
// Adapters provide access to resources. For instance, a Google Workspace adapter might provide
// access to Google Docs, Spreadsheets, Gmail mailboxes, etc. Each Google Doc, for example, is a
// separate "resource". Adapters are designed to provide object-oriented, capability-based access
// to such resources, enabling the Gadget Workshop to grant a particular Gadget fine-grained
// access to just the things the user wants that Gadget to access.
//
// Each adapter is deployed as a completely independent Cloud Run service from the Gadgets
// Workshop itself. The Workshop communicates with the adapter over JavaScript RPC. The types in this file define that RPC interface. The
// `Adapter` type is the root interface implemented by the service binding.

   * event occurs. Although `callback` is always a persistent stub (see below), the gatekeeper
   * should NOT try to store it on its own; it should always pass it to `bindHook` for the overseer
   * to store. Why? Because the callback needs to be bound to a particular gatekeeper *session*.
   * At the time you are calling `bindHook()`, the callback is tied to the session that is tied
   * to the `ApprovalQueue`. But that session will end at some point, after which the callback stub
   * you received is revoked. When you call HookInitiator.startHook() later on, that actually
   * initiates a *new* session (returning a new `ApprovalQueue`), and the callback returned then
   * is tied to that session instead.
   *
   * `controller` is an object implemented by the gatekeeper which allows the overseer to enable
   * or disable the hook.
   *
   * The hook is not immediately enabled, as the user may need to approve it first. If and when
   * the user has approved, the overseer will call controller.enable() to request that the the
   * gatekeeper begin delivering hook events. If the user never approves, no call will ever be
   * made. Therefore, the gatekeeper should avoid storing any state until the hook is enabled.
   * Typically, the `HookController` implementation should capture all information it needs to
   * register the hook into `props` so that it doesn't need to store anything elsewhere.
   *
   * In a typical implementation, the gatekeeper may expose an API to the gadget like:
   *
   *     onSomeEvent(callback: RpcStub<SomeInterface>)
   *
   * Where `SomeInterface` can be either an RpcTarget-derived interface, or a function type, but
   * either way the stub must be a persistent stub (see below). The gadget could call `onSomeEvent`
   * directly, but more commonly an agent will call it in a one-off `executeCode` tool call, since
   * this is usually one-time setup, not something that happens programmatically. The
   * implementation of `onSomeEvent` constructs a `HookController` implementation whose `props`
   * specify the details of the event to be hooked, then calls `bindHook()` to register the hook.
   * When the user approves, the overseer calls `controller.enable()`, which takes the provided
   * `HookInitiator` object and stores it somewhere where it can be invoked whenever "SomeEvent"
   * occurs. When the event occurs, first the gatekeeper calls `hookInitiator.startHook()` to
   * notify the overseer that a hook is incoming. The overseer returns back the original `callback`
   * stub along with an `ApprovalQueue`. Next the gatekeeper calls `authorizeObservation()` on the
   * `ApprovalQueue` -- since a hook invocation is almost always an observation of some sort.
   * Finally, it invokes the `callback` object to deliver the event to the gadget.
   *
   * Persistent stubs are a Cap'n Web feature. The kernel stores a *capability record*
