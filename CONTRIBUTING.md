# Contributing to Company OS

At this time, we are not seeking outside contribution.

AI has made writing code easy. The hard part, today, is not writing the code, but reviewing it, making sure quality stays high, and keeping the product coherent. In that light, unfortunately, external code contributions are "donating" the easy part of the job, while creating more of the hard work.

With that said, we are happy to accept small, trivially-verified PRs that fix a problem. However, we ask that you refrain from submitting low-value PRs (e.g. typo fixes) or PRs that are more than a dozen or so lines. Such PRs will be closed with a reference to this guideline.

If you have a big idea you'd like us to consider, feel free to open a discussion about it.

This policy may change in the future as the project matures. Until then, thank you for your understanding.

## What CI runs on your pull request

Lint, build and tests ([`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) run on every pull request, including
those from forks. The clean-tree assertion fails if a forbidden vendor token appears in tracked files.
